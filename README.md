# MiniSTL
Containers, Memory Managment, Logging, Misc

This is Work In Progress. 


## RATIONALE

###mini::Array
- simple implementation (easy to understand, debug, extend and use with custom allocators)
- no use of exceptions, guards can be toggled
- preserve order is optional
- either lives entirely on heap or entirely on stack

###mini::Allocator
wip
