- camera direction (quaternion)
- sun pos addition on camera pos + cam dir
- cascade fade

- what to draw on specific cascades
- cast shadow flag 

- scene tree, selection, highlight

- shadow and general pipeline synopsis (instance draw) one big state with sub states
- recalculate props height on terrain when terrain recalculated??

- test against all quadrant and choose closest
- dirty quadrants (only upload and stich)

-----------------------------------------

- better grass
- global input mapping
- input mode (enum class) refactor

- refactor all shaders
- shader material data rework

- matrix rework with concepts

- scene reload
- utils separation into multiple headers
- widget list refactor (only update the visible region)
- simple function ptr based system for gui callback
(since updating the scene tree every frame is wasteful)
- load both material and mesh paths externally
- FOR_ENUM_MAP macro for loop
- appropriate color picker widget
- don't xcopy whole shader folder (glsl sources) but only spv
