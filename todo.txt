- shader injection instead of hardcoding
- only draw terrain on far cascades
- object highlighting
- shadow and general pipeline synopsis
- only upload terrain quadrants that actually have changed (dirty)
- recalculate y position of props when terrain changes
- basic frustrum culling (AABB)
- global input mapping
- scene restart

- ... too much :)
